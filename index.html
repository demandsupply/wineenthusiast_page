                    Low- and no-sugar wines, often marketed with a “better for you” positioning,
                    aim to appeal to health-conscious wine lovers. Consumption of these wines 
                    can be tied to other movements, too, including keto, low-carb, organic and
                    <a href="https://www.winemag.com/2018/05/09/vegetarian-vegan-wine/">vegan diets</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While almost every dry wine on the market is low in residual sugar, the wines 
                    that are labeled and marketed as low- or no-sugar are deliberately produced from 
                    vineyard to bottle with the aim of lowering the amount of sugar, carbohydrates 
                    and alcohol in each serving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number of brands devoted to this mission seems to increase exponentially 
                    with each passing month, but it wasn’t always this way. Whether the trend was 
                    forecast by a savvy marketing team or developed in response to an observed need, 
                    low-sugar wines took time to bring to market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We started to hear about a trend towards lower alcohol when we were attending 
                    <a href="https://www.prowein.com/">ProWein</a> in 2019,” says 
                    <a href="https://www.winemag.com/2020/10/27/heidi-scheid-person-year-wsa2020/">Heidi Scheid</a>,
                    executive vice president of <a href="https://www.scheidfamilywines.com/">Scheid Family Wines</a>,
                    which produces <a href="https://sunnywines.com/">Sunny With a Chance of Flowers</a>. 
                    The brand offers five varieties, with no sugar and 85 calories per glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Personally, I was invested because I was always on the hunt for lower alcohol wines,” 
                    she says. “I needed a weekday wine that I could drink a few glasses of and still get up 
                    at the crack of dawn for a run. So it became a topic at our internal product innovation 
                    meetings at first. The zero-sugar part of Sunny was actually more of a hunch.”

                    And yet, sugar plays a significant role in wine production, regardless of 
                    whether the finished pour is sweet or dry or somewhere in between. To understand 
                    low-sugar wines, then, you have to dig into how they’re made and what actually 
                    ends up in your glass.
                </p>
                <h3>Sugar’s Important Role in Wine</h3>
                <p>Without sugar, there would be no wine.</p>
                <p>
                    It’s often stated that all wine begins in the vineyard, and so is the case for sugar 
                    in wine. As grapes ripen, photosynthesis breaks down sucrose in leaves into glucose 
                    and fructose, and transfers it to the berries. While sugar is rising within the grapes, 
                    acids and pH levels also change. The more sunlight and daytime heat grapes receive, 
                    the faster they will ripen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fermentation process entails yeast consuming the naturally occurring sugar in grapes 
                    and producing ethanol and carbon dioxide as a result. <a href="https://www.winemag.com/2020/12/02/yeast-wine-beer-science/">Yeast</a>
                    will continue to transform 
                    sugar into this type of alcohol until the sugar is completely digested or the yeast is 
                    destroyed or removed—the latter results in wine with residual sugar.

                        <p>STOP TRYING TO MAKE "HEALTHY COCKTAILS HAPPEN"</p>
                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Simply put, the more sugar present in the grape, the higher potential for sugar or 
                    alcohol in the finished wine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Residual sugar (RS) refers to the amount of sugar left in wine after fermentation. 
                    Measured in grams per liter (g/L), it is an indication of a wine’s sweetness. 
                    While European Union regulations stipulate that dry wine contains less than 4 
                    g/L RS, there are no such requirements in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, RS is linked to alcohol level. This is largely the case in wines that 
                    are produced using traditional methods. Based on the principle of fermentation, 
                    it should hold true that a wine high in residual sugar will have lower alcohol and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, German <a href="https://www.winemag.com/varietals/riesling/">Riesling</a> Kabinett 
                    with 45 g/L RS may have 8% <a href="https://www.winemag.com/2021/11/24/proof-different-abv/">alcohol by volume</a> 
                    (abv), and a <a href="https://www.winemag.com/region/moscato-dasti/">Moscato d’Asti</a> with 
                    120 g/L RS may have only 5% abv. But, a higher alcohol wine, such as 
                    <a href="https://www.winemag.com/varietals/cabernet-sauvignon/">Napa Cab</a>, can have 14.5% abv and just 1.5 g/L RS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To minimize naturally occurring sugars for low- and no-sugar wines, winemakers use viticultural techniques such as 
                    <a href="https://www.winemag.com/2017/10/17/why-vineyards-and-vines-look-different-from-one-another/">canopy management</a>, 
                    or the placement or trimming of leaves to shade or expose the grapes to sun. Daytime shade and cooler 
                    nighttime temperatures help to preserve acidity in grapes and keep sugar levels from getting too high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We carefully prune the vines to maximize leaf protection from the hot summer sun,” 
                    says David Joeky, senior winemaker for <a href="https://www.casellafamilybrands.com/">Casella Family Brands</a> 
                    who oversees production on <a href="https://www.yellowtailpurebright.com/">Yellow Tail Pure Bright</a>. 
                    “This protects the grapes and slows [sugar] development while promoting fruit flavor and intensity. 
                    We pick the grapes at precisely the right time to maximize brightness and acidity,
                     and they are harvested in the cool of the night.”
                </p>
                <h3>Clarifying the Claims</h3>
                <p>
                    Many brands in the “better for you” space make questionable marketing claims. 
                    One of the most significant of these statements is “no added sugar,” which 
                    implies that wine is, in general, made with additional sugar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is largely not the case for most dry wines, though there are exceptions. Some 
                    mass-produced wines may have added sugar to make the wine sweeter, and sugar can 
                    also be introduced before or during fermentation to reach a higher alcohol level in 
                    a process called chaptalization. This technique can be utilized in some cool-weather 
                    wine regions in which grapes ripen at a slower pace and winemakers need to supplement 
                    the natural sugar present.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, wine labels may not always inform consumers if the wine is sweet.</p>
                <p>
                    “There are a lot of consumers who partake in low-sugar diets or limit sugar intake due 
                    to health issues,” says Scheid. “Of course, there are many wines that are zero sugar, 
                    but nowhere does it say that on the label, so consumers don’t know.”
                </p>
                <p>The new low- and no-sugar brands proudly wear their numbers on their labels.</p>
                <div class="cit">

                    “Crafting Yellow Tail Pure Bright took time and effort as we experimented with 
                    different winemaking techniques to perfect the alcohol reduction process,” 
                    says Joeky. “A key aspect of the winemaking process is a specific type of 
                    filtration that protects and concentrates all the flavors and aromas in the 
                    wine. We utilize specific filtration and other similar techniques incorporated 
                    with blending to deliver vibrant and full-flavored wines, with the added 
                    benefit of reduced calories.”

                    Sunny With a Chance of Flowers uses precise harvesting and vinification 
                    techniques to produce its zero sugar wines, coupled with advanced 
                    winemaking techniques to lower total alcohol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We harvest the fruit for Sunny at peak maturity and full phenolic 
                    ripeness from our estate vineyards just as we would a regular alcohol wine,” 
                    says Scheid. “The grapes are brought to our estate winery, crushed and 
                    fermented to dryness. That’s how we get to zero sugar—we continue 
                    fermentation until there is no residual sugar remaining. For the alcohol removal, 
                    we use a proprietary process based on reverse osmosis. During this process, 
                    alcohol is gently and gradually pulled from the wine, leaving behind a 
                    reduced-alcohol product.”

                <p>Another brand offering low-sugar selections is Kind of Wild, a 
                    direct-to-consumer line of organic and vegan wines.</p>

                        <p>INHERENT VICE: THE MEDIA'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH "HEALTHY" ALCOHOL</p>

                    “Feedback showed that organic and vegan were higher priority to 
                    our customers than sugar and alcohol levels,” says cofounder Jordan Sager. 
                    “So, for our brand, we see sugar and alcohol as important, but perhaps 
                    secondary benefits while our organic and vegan certifications are primary.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We also believe the wines should align with one’s lifestyle of moderation,” 
                    he adds. “That is why we want our wines to be in the 11–13% abv range 
                    instead of 14% plus, and why we look for balanced wines that have less 
                    than 0.5 grams of sugar per 5-ounce glass.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    As in all wines, balance is key, and so is alignment with your 
                    personal palate. If lower sugar is important, try some options and find 
                    the wine you like best. After all, enjoying wine is one of life’s sweetest pleasures.
